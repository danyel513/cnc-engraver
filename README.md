# Laser Engraving Robot Project

This project, developed under the guidance of Nokia representatives, involved designing and building a laser engraving robot from scratch. The robot is capable of engraving various images, logos, and text onto materials such as wood, metal, and more. Below, we outline the components, functionality, and software architecture of the system.

## Features
- **Versatile Material Engraving**: Supports engraving on materials like wood and metal.
- **High Precision**: Uses a laser diode and electric motors for accurate positioning.
- **Customizable Input**: Accepts `.gcode` files generated from specialized image translation software.
- **Arduino-Controlled**: Operates via an Arduino microcontroller for serial communication and command execution.

## System Components
### 1. **Mechanical Frame**
- A sturdy **metal frame** supports all components.
- **Electric motors** (stepper motors) control the laser's position along the X and Y axes for precise engraving.

### 2. **Laser Module**
- Equipped with a **high-power laser diode** capable of engraving materials by emitting a focused beam of light.
- Adjustable power settings to accommodate different material types and thicknesses.

### 3. **Microcontroller**
- The robot is powered by an **Arduino microcontroller** that:
  - Interprets `.gcode` files containing engraving instructions.
  - Communicates with the motors and laser via **serial communication**.

### 4. **Specialized Software**
- A **gcode generator** translates images, logos, or text into coordinate-based engraving commands.
- The gcode file is then sent to the Arduino for execution.

## How It Works
1. **Image Translation**:  
   Input images or text are processed by specialized software to generate a `.gcode` file containing positional and laser intensity instructions.

2. **Serial Communication**:  
   The `.gcode` file is sent to the Arduino microcontroller via a USB connection.

3. **Motor Control**:  
   Stepper motors receive commands to move the laser to specific coordinates on the material surface.

4. **Laser Engraving**:  
   The laser diode emits a focused beam of light to engrave the material as per the provided instructions.
